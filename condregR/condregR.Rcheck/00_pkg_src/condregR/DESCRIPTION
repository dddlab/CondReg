Description: Implementation of condition-number-regularized covariance estimation
    based on Won et al. (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2012.01049.x>. This method
    regularizes covariance matrices by constraining their condition number, which
    improves statistical efficiency and numerical stability. The package provides
    tools for cross-validation, portfolio optimization and efficient computation
    using a high-performance C++ backend with Eigen linear algebra library.
