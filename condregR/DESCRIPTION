Description: R interface to the C++ implementation of condition number 
    regularization for covariance matrices. This package provides efficient methods
    for regularizing covariance matrices by controlling their condition number,
    which is useful for portfolio optimization and other applications where
    well-conditioned covariance matrices are needed.
